## About This Repo

🎪 We will be building a Button-to-Emoji application with buttons and a list using [Event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) and [The Event Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Event_loop)!

[Event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) is like ordering food at a restaurant. You sit patiently waiting, taking no action, until the waiter brings your meal. This signals an [event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events) has occurred, triggering you to eat. Similarly in code, [functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) wait idle until an event like a click or keyboard input happens. [Event handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) are then called to respond appropriately. This creates responsive programs that don't constantly check for changes, improving efficiency.
